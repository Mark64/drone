// calibrate sensors must be called before this function is called
//   since there is no guaruntee the calibration would finish before the system begins
//   moving
// because the time to retrieve the orientation is subject to a variable number of factors
//   which can become unpredictable as the complexity of the system increases, this semi-complex
//   function is used to simplify the process (or complicate it, depending on your religious
//   views)
// when you call this function, the internal implementation spins up a variable number of threads
//   to handle all the sensor inputs and computations, which reduces wasted CPU time and improves
//   performance
// once the implementation has determined that it has enough data to provide and updated
//   representation of the system's orientation, it calls the passed in function pointer with
//   the updated Orientation struct as the sole argument
// note that the completionHandler function is called on a different thread, so it should be
//   thread safe
// this will continue as long as the system continues to function properly, which can be undesired
//   while the system doesn't need the orientation (while landed for example)
// for this reason, you can stop the continuous updates by passing a -1 as the return value for
//   your completion handler
//   a 0 return value indicates that the orientation updates can proceed
//   a negative return value indicates the updates should stop
//   a positive return value changes the update Hz to the returned value for the
//     listener
// since multithreaded systems can be complicated (citation needed), it is recommended that
//   the completion handler be able to handle a few additional update calls
//   after passing a -1 to stop updates, though this hopefully won't ever be an issue
// the second argument is the desired update rate in Hz, which determines approximately how
//   often the completionHandler will be called
// returns 0 on success and -1 on failure
